# Who do you ***git*** you are 

This project was designed to provide an opportunity to familiarise myself with the GitHub REST API.

## Reviewing the project

A GitHub token is required to access the REST API. 
Clone the project into your local editor and insert your GitHub token into line 4 of [main.js](/main.js)
``git clone https://github.com/eliazzo/Who_do_you_git_you_are``
